Intelligent Racing Project for [NXP Cup National University Students Intelligent Car Race](https://community.nxp.com/t5/The-NXP-Cup-EMEA/gh-p/15351)

## Overview
This is the guiding algorithm from HKUST Robotics Team (Smart Car Subteam) for NXP Cup National University Students Intellignet Car Race.

## Race Track Schematic

It is really important to handle the car movement at the intersection on the middle of the track. 
The algorithm must ensure that the car is automatically guided straightfoward at the intersection, not to move left or right.

## Hardware
i.MX RT1052 Crossover MCU with ARM Cortex-M7 Core has been used.
